# DSA Practice

This repository contains my practice implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Each problem has its own folder containing:
- Solution file(s) in Python or TypeScript
- Problem description and requirements
- Test cases
- Any additional resources or notes

## Structure

Each problem folder follows this naming convention:
```
problem-name/
├── solution.py (or solution.ts)
├── README.md (problem description and approach)
├── test_cases.txt (if applicable)
└── resources/ (any additional materials)
```

## Language

Most solutions are implemented in Python and TypeScript, as it provides a clean and readable syntax for expressing algorithms.

## Resources

- LeetCode
- GeeksforGeeks
- Cracking the Coding Interview
- Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
